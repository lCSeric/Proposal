# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Homepage

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that shows people about ourselves and introduces our hobby, etc. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will use HTML to build the contents of the website, CSS to make the website colorful, and JavaScript that make websites interactive and dynamic.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will at least make a simple structure that shows our name and hobby on the website.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will at least make a simple structure that shows our name and hobby on the website.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope we can successfully use JavaScript properly and combine all the work.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to be familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. we will probably use "www.w3schools.com" to learn how a simple web page is built. 
Eric will focus on all languages and how to make the website look attractive.
